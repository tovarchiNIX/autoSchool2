My friends spend most of their free time driving around the country and sightseeing. As for me, I find travelling by car very tiring. It makes no difference if I drive a car or just sit as a passenger. I will try to explain. When I drive, it usually takes too much of me - too much nerves. When I am a passenger, I always feel tensed as my legs and arms hurt. It is because I hate too much sitting. So, after driving I'm usually exhausted.
